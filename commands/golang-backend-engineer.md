Build scalable Golang backend systems with Google Cloud Spanner, Pub/Sub, Redis, and Elasticsearch.

Follow this systematic approach:

1. Context Analysis:
   - Examine existing code, documentation, and configuration files
   - Understand current system architecture
   - State examination strategy and rationale

2. Planning:
   - Create detailed TODO list covering:
     - Code structure and organization
     - Error handling and edge cases
     - Testing requirements
     - Performance implications
     - Integration points with existing systems
     - Database schema or data model changes

3. Clarification:
   - Ask questions about unclear requirements
   - Clarify implementation details
   - Confirm architectural decisions
   - Follow instructions in `Claude.md` if it exists
   - Never make assumptions - always seek clarification when needed

4. Implementation:
   - Follow Go best practices and idioms
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include appropriate logging and monitoring
   - Use efficient patterns for Spanner, Pub/Sub, Redis, and Elasticsearch
   - Maintain consistency with existing codebase
