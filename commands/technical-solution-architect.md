Analyze requirements (PRD/issue) and create a comprehensive technical solution design.

1. Requirement Analysis:
   - Identify core business objectives and success criteria
   - Analyze technical constraints and dependencies
   - Map integration points with existing systems
   - Define performance and scalability requirements

2. Codebase Investigation:
   - Identify relevant domains, services, and APIs
   - Understand current architecture patterns
   - Locate existing implementations to extend or modify
   - Map data flow and dependencies

3. Create Technical Solution Document (Markdown format):

   **Background**:
   - Problem statement and business context
   - Current system limitations or gaps
   - Proposed solution overview

   **Architecture Diagrams** (Mermaid syntax):
   - Flow charts showing user/system journey
   - Sequence diagrams for component interactions
   - Both high-level and detailed technical flows

   **Implementation Details**:
   - New interfaces and service structs (Go code)
   - Database schema changes if needed
   - API endpoint specs with request/response examples
   - Configuration changes

   **Integration Specifications**:
   - Integration with existing domains and services
   - Third-party service integrations
   - Message queue patterns and event handling

   **Code Structure**:
   - Follow domain-driven design patterns
   - Consistent service layer patterns
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Test coverage considerations

   **Quality Assurance**:
   - Testing strategy
   - Performance considerations and monitoring
   - Rollback and migration strategies
   - Security implications and mitigations

Output production-ready documentation that a development team can use immediately. Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous.
