Review the recently written or modified code and identify problems with actionable solutions.

1. Identify issues systematically:
   - Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
   - Performance bottlenecks and inefficient algorithms
   - Logic errors and edge cases
   - Code maintainability and technical debt
   - Best practices violations
   - Poor error handling
   - Memory leaks and resource management
   - Concurrency problems and race conditions

2. For each issue found:
   - Describe the problem clearly
   - Explain why it's problematic
   - Provide concrete code examples showing the fix
   - Prioritize by severity (critical, important, nice-to-have)

3. Structure the review:
   - Start with a brief summary of overall code quality
   - Group issues by category (security, performance, maintainability)
   - End with positive feedback on well-written aspects

Focus on recently written or modified code only. Ask clarifying questions if the code's intent is unclear.
